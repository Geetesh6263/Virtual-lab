         To determine intital and final setting time of cement.

        <b>Theory</b>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        For convenience, initial setting time is regarded as the time elapsed between the moments that the water is added to the cement, to the time that the paste starts losing its plasticity. The final setting time is the time elapsed between the moment the water is added to the cement, and the time when the paste has completely lost its plasticity and has attained sufficient firmness to resist certain definite pressure. The temperature of moulding room, dry materials and water shall be maintained at 27 ± 2°C. The relative humidity of the laboratory shall be 65 ± 5 percent.
